Weather Dashboard:

Create a web application that displays current weather information for different cities.
Users can search for cities and view detailed weather forecasts.
Use Apache Camel to periodically fetch weather data from the weather API and store it in a database.
Spring Boot can handle the backend logic and serve the frontend using Thymeleaf or any other frontend framework.

Weather Alerts System:

Build a system that sends weather alerts to users based on their preferences and location.
Users can subscribe to receive alerts for specific weather conditions (e.g., thunderstorms, heavy rainfall) in their area.
Apache Camel can periodically check the weather API for updates and send notifications using email or SMS.
Spring Boot can handle user authentication, preferences management, and communication with the Camel routes.
